# PayTM

[PayTM](https://paytm.com/) Payment Gateway provides a secure, PCI-compliant way to accept Debit/Credit card, Net-Banking, UPI and Paytm wallet payments from your customers.

## Setup

1. [Create account](https://dashboard.paytm.com) or [login](https://dashboard.paytm.com) using your existing Paytm account.
2. Generate your [staging account credentials](https://dashboard.paytm.com/next/apikeys?src=dev) from the dashboard. These are required to explore Paytm's integration solutions.
3. When you are ready to go live, [activate your account](https://dashboard.paytm.com/next/activate?src=dev) in the dashboard to get production account credentials.

## Configure PayTM in Admin

In your store's Admin, go to **Payments** -> **Payment Methods**, click to **Settings** of the PayTM payment method,
and it will open the configuration section.
